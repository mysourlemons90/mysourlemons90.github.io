## Sample Monthly Online Purchases

### What is being visualised?

This page demonstrates how **quantitative data** can be visualised using **Quarto and R**.

The dataset represents the number of online purchases made per month over a six-month period.

### Why this visualisation?

A **line chart** is used because it clearly shows changes and trends over time.

## Visualisation

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
# Sample dataset
months <- c("Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec", "Jan")
purchases <- c(5, 8, 6, 12, 15, 9)

# Create plot
plot(1:6, purchases, type="o", pch=16, col="steelblue", lwd=2,
     xlab="Month", ylab="Number of Purchases", 
     main="Sample Monthly Online Purchases", xaxt="n", ylim=c(0,17))
axis(1, at=1:6, labels=months)
grid(nx=NA, ny=NULL, lty=2, col="gray90")
```

## Story Behind This Visualisation

This visualisation was created as part of a student project analyzing personal spending patterns. The data shows:

-   **Holiday spike** in November-December (Black Friday and holiday shopping)
-   **Post-holiday decline** in January (budget recovery)
-   **Stable baseline** in August-October (5-8 purchases per month)

The line chart effectively shows the temporal trend and makes patterns immediately visible.
